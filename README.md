## Frequency Filer

#Opening and reading a document, then displaying the frequency of words in the document.

This Python program opens a text file, reads it, and compiles all the words in the document into a list, or dictionary. 
The dictionary shows the number of times the words are used, then takes the top 20 words used and outputs them in reverse order along with their frequency.
